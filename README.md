# Texas Instruments TI99/4A Motherboard Replacement Project

This is a work-in-progress!  I am currently tracking down errors in the schematic, and it should not be trusted as 100% accurate at this point!

This is based on the HackMac KiCAD schematics with corrections as I have been working through them.   All of the labels have been changed to global, as I find them far easier to work with.

Please note that this has also been converted to KiCAD 6.x.
